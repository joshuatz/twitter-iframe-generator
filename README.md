## What is this?
Tiny tool to generate an `<iframe>` embed from any given tweet, which you can then use on any site that accepts them, or in your own code.

## Why?
The default embed code that Twitter gives you requires a high level of trust; you have to load third-party external JavaScript onto your site, which could potentially be exploited.

## Downsides
See [my project post](https://joshuatz.com/projects/web-stuff/twitter-iframe-embed-generator/) for more details, but to summarize:

 - This method does not allow for responsive embeds
 - Embeds could potentially get blocked by users who have disabled iframe content

This tool is not affiliated with Twitter in any official capacity. Please use it responsibly, adhering to the Twitter TOS, and your local laws and regulations.
